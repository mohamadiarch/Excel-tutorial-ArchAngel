After downloading and unzipping, put it in your xlstart folder which will load it when you start Excel. The folder location is different for each version of Excel, but is generally somewhere under:

     or

For Office 365 subscription the xlstart folder is generally here:

C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\xlstart
